    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm currently a Web Development student who made this website
      as a project to showcase what I've learnt via the use of HTML and CSS
      so far. 
      <br>
      On this page you can expect to find details of projects that I
      have created (that aren't exclusive to web-development) that consist
      of audio files that I have contsructed in Logic Pro X.<br> 
      I plan on uploading files I created of various genres to this site and using it as a hub for producers to find high-quality loops.
      <br>
      Over time I will update this website with knew knowledge gained to make it more optimised, appealing to the eye, interactive and hopefully use it as a portfolio for future work
    </p>

       <h3>HTML</h3>
       <p>
         After indulging in HTML, I've found joy in crafting and recreating sections of websites. My moderate experience has empowered me to navigate through the intricacies of HTML, allowing me to bring my design ideas to life. I take pride in dissecting and reconstructing web elements with plans of mastering the art of structuring content and enhancing user experience. As I continue to expand my skills, I look forward to tackling more complex challenges and contributing my expertise to the ever-evolving web development landscape

       <h3>CSS</h3>
       <p>
         With a solid grasp of CSS, I've honed my skills in styling and transforming web content. My moderate experience has equipped me to apply styles, enhance layouts, and create visually appealing sections on websites. I find satisfaction in the creative possibilities CSS offers, and I am further refining my abilities in bringing aesthetics to digital life.
